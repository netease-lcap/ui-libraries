# Storybook for Vue 2 and Vite

> 原包不支持 vue 2.7 以下版本， 所以迁移到这里

Storybook for Vue 2 is a UI development environment for your Vue 2 components.
With it, you can visualize different states of your UI components and develop them interactively.

Storybook runs outside of your app.
So you can develop UI components in isolation without worrying about app specific dependencies and requirements.

## Getting Started

```sh
cd my-vue-app
npx storybook@latest init
```

## Starter Storybook-for-Vue Boilerplate project with [Vuetify](https://github.com/vuetifyjs/vuetify) Material Component Framework

Storybook also comes with a lot of [addons](https://storybook.js.org/addons) and a great API to customize as you wish.
You can also build a [static version](https://storybook.js.org/docs/vue/sharing/publish-storybook) of your Storybook and deploy it anywhere you want.

## Vue Notes

- When using global custom components or extensions (e.g., `Vue.use`). You will need to declare those in the `./storybook/preview.js`.

## Known Limitations

In Storybook story and decorator components, you can not access the Vue instance
in factory functions for default prop values:

```js
{
  props: {
    foo: {
      default() {
        return this.bar; // does not work!
      }
    }
  }
}
```
